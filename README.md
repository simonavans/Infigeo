A rythm-based platformer heavily inspired by the mobile game Geometry Dash. I've made this project alone for the 2D Graphics course of Computer Science (Avans University of Applied Sciences).

The game is an automatically scrolling platformer where the player controls a cube by making it jump. Crashing into blocks or spikes resets the game. The player can create their own levels by editing a JSON-file (0 for air, 1 for a block and 2 for a spike). The level will then be infinitely repeated. The player can also switch between player skins. The project uses Java and Java2D (graphics) under the hood.
